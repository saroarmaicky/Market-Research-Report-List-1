<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thulium Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Thulium sputtering target market is divided into two main types: rotary and non-rotatable. Rotary targets facilitate continuous, efficient deposition over larger surface areas due to their cylindrical shape that rotates during the sputtering process. This enhances uniformity and improves material utilization. In contrast, non-rotatable targets are fixed in position during deposition, which may be suitable for smaller-scale applications or specific designs requiring precise targeting of the substrate. Both types serve distinct needs in thin-film deposition technologies.</p></p>
