<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Encoders for Industrial Robots Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absolute Encoders</li><li>Relative Encoders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The market for encoders in industrial robots is primarily categorized into absolute and relative encoders. Absolute encoders provide a unique position value within a full rotation, allowing for precise control and high accuracy, making them ideal for applications that require exact positioning. In contrast, relative encoders, also known as incremental encoders, measure motion from a specific position, offering a simpler design and lower cost, but requiring a reference point for positioning. Both types are vital for enhancing robotic performance and efficiency.</p></p>
