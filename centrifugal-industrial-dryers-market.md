<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Industrial Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal industrial dryers are primarily categorized into direct and indirect markets based on their methods of heat application. Direct dryers introduce hot air or gases directly into the material, facilitating rapid moisture evaporation. They are efficient for bulk materials with a short drying time. In contrast, indirect dryers rely on heated surfaces or conduction without direct contact with the drying medium, making them suitable for heat-sensitive materials. Both types cater to specific industrial needs and moisture removal challenges.</p></p>
