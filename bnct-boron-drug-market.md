<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The BNCT Boron Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Molecule Boron Drugs</li><li>Boron-bound Biological Complexes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The BNCT (Boron Neutron Capture Therapy) boron drug market can be divided into two main types: small molecule boron drugs and boron-bound biological complexes. Small molecule boron drugs are synthetic compounds designed to selectively deliver boron to tumor cells, enhancing the efficacy of neutron irradiation. In contrast, boron-bound biological complexes involve the attachment of boron to biomolecules like antibodies or peptides, facilitating targeted therapy through specific interactions with cancer cells. Both types aim to improve therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment.</p></p>
