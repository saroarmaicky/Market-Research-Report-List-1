<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Steel Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrical Galvanized Steel Tubes</li><li>Hot-dip Galvanized Steel Tubes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The galvanized steel tubes market comprises primarily two types: electrical galvanized steel tubes and hot-dip galvanized steel tubes. Electrical galvanized steel tubes are coated through an electrochemical process, providing a uniform, thinner zinc layer, ideal for applications requiring moderate corrosion resistance. In contrast, hot-dip galvanized steel tubes undergo immersion in molten zinc, resulting in a thicker, more robust coating that offers superior protection against corrosion, making them suitable for outdoor and heavy-duty applications. Both types serve diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
